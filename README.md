# Temperature-Alert-System
A temperature monitoring system that uses a DS18B20 sensor to measure temperature and an OLED display to show the current temperature. When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, a red LED lights up and a buzzer sounds to alert the user. A green LED indicates that the temperature is within the safe range.
